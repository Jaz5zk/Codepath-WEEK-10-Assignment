# Codepath-WEEK-10-Assignment
•	Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP
•	Any issues you encountered
As always, I encountered some issues with downloading the VM’s but other than that running the honeypot attack was easy
•	A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.

•	Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
I am curious whether we need every single thing that was downloaded in this assignment or if some of it was just unnecessarily downloaded
